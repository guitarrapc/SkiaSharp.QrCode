    /// content that overflows every version in a single mode — unless the minimal-bit
    /// plan would be misread on decode (a relocated byte order mark, or a Latin-1

    /// "does not fit" rather than emitting a stream that decodes differently.

    /// (Micro QR content never exceeds 35 characters). The plan respects each
    /// version's mode set — M1 is Numeric-only and M2 has no Byte mode — so a
    /// version is never selected for a plan whose runs it cannot carry. Size buffers
    /// with the same segmentation you encode with, the two can select different
    /// versions.
