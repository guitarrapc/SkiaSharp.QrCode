/// a time. No module byte is touched more than once and no output bit is handled
/// individually.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Deliberately not a port of the x64 bit-plane kernel. NEON has neither PEXT nor
/// PDEP, so instead of a plane per column plus a deposit step, one 32-bit lane holds a
/// whole column pair: bit <c>2j+1</c> is the pair's right column and <c>2j</c> its
/// left, where j counts data rows in walk order. The walk alternates between a pair's
/// two columns on every row, so that word already <em>is</em> the pair's output field
/// with the function modules still in it, and the pair operation collapses to a single
/// PEXT-shaped compress with no deposit at all.
/// <para>
/// The compress uses what ARM does have. A pair's data mask is a handful of runs of
/// consecutive bits, because function modules come from rectangular blocks (finder,
/// sub-finder, format, alignment) rather than scattered modules, and one run is one AND
/// plus one shift. The runs of the whole symbol are one flat table, so no pair pays for
/// another pair's worst case.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Measured ratios, the per-bit cost model behind having no size switch, and the
/// rejected alternatives are recorded in .github/docs/specs/rmqr-decoder.md; the kernel
