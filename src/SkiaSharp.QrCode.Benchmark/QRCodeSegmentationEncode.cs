/// <summary>
/// What <c>QRCodeSegmentation.Optimal</c> costs against <c>Single</c>, encoding the same
/// content through the same zero-allocation span path.
///
/// The Ratio column is the end-to-end multiplier a caller actually pays — but note it is
/// not the planning cost in isolation. On the rows where the split wins, the Optimal arm
/// lands on a smaller version and therefore also does less ECC, placement and module
/// writing, so the ratio nets planning against a cheaper encode.
///
/// Count indicator widths are constant within the three version bands (1-9 / 10-26 /
/// 27-40), so the planner runs at most three O(n) cost passes plus one reconstruction
/// pass, and a trivial single-pass bound rejects candidates no split could fit before
/// any cost pass runs. The shapes separate the paths the scan can take:
///
///   numeric-*  : all digits, one mode is provably optimal, no cost run at all
///   alnum-120  : single-mode content the trivial bound rules out without a cost run
///   byte-120   : the same, in Byte mode
///   alt1-120   : alternating every character — the bound's blind spot: it pays for
///                a cost run (one, within the 1-9 band its scan window spans) and
///                gains nothing
///   mixed-*    : half letters half digits; 120/1000 win a version, mixed-20 does
///                not (its 140-bit optimum misses v1-M's 128 bits) and emits the
///                Single stream — the priced-but-no-candidate-fits path
///   url-58     : a realistic payload (version 4-M as one run, version 3-M split)
///   utf8-60    : multi-byte runs behind an ECI prefix
///
/// Every fixture fits under Single too, so no row compares a success with a throw.
/// ECC M only: other levels shift which version wins but not the shape of the work.
