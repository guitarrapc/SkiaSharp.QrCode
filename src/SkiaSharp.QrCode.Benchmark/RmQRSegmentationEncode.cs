/// <summary>
/// What <c>RmQRSegmentation.Optimal</c> costs against <c>Single</c>, encoding the same
/// content through the same zero-allocation span path.
///
/// The Ratio column is the end-to-end multiplier a caller actually pays, which is the
/// number worth quoting — but note it is not the planning cost in isolation. On the
/// rows where the split wins, the Optimal arm lands on a smaller version and therefore
/// also does less ECC, placement and module writing, so the ratio nets planning against
/// a cheaper encode and understates the planning overhead. Six of the twelve shapes
/// below change version between the two arms.
///
/// This is a separate class from <see cref="RmQREncodeEndToEnd"/> on purpose. That one
/// varies version and mode with the version pinned, and ranks everything against one
/// baseline row; this one varies content shape with the version free, and every row is
/// meaningless without its same-run partner. Mixing them would make both tables harder
/// to read and both filters slower to run.
///
/// The shapes are chosen to separate the two things that drive planning cost:
///
///   Length, shape held fixed   : mixed-20 / -60 / -120 / -150 (half letters, half digits)
///   Shape, length held at 120  : numeric / alnum / byte / mixed / alt1 / alt10
///
/// and to cover every filter the scan can terminate in (measured DP passes per encode
/// in brackets — the scan is bounded before it is priced, so most shapes never build a
/// table at all):
///
///   numeric-*  : all digits, so one mode is provably optimal and the short-circuit
///                returns before any bound is computed [0 passes]
///   alnum-120  : the trivial O(n) bound rejects every better-ranked version, so no
///                cost run happens [0 passes]
///   byte-150   : the same, at the byte capacity boundary [0 passes]
///   alt1-120   : alternating every character. The trivial bound cannot rule this out
///                (it prices each digit at the numeric rate, ignoring that switching
///                every character never pays), so the floor runs and then rejects
///                everything — it plans and gains nothing [1 pass]
///   alt10-120  : alternating every ten, where a per-version cost run is what decides
///                the version rather than a bound [3 passes]
///   mixed-*    : the common shape; the upper bound accepts without a per-version run
///                [2 passes: floor + building the chosen plan]
///   url-38     : a realistic payload (R11x77 as one run, R15x43 split) [2 passes]
///   utf8-60    : multi-byte runs behind an ECI prefix; like alt1-120 it plans and
///                gains nothing, landing on the same version in both arms [2 passes]
///
/// Every fixture fits under Single too, so no row is comparing a success with a throw.
/// ECC M only: the H capacities shift which version wins but not the shape of the work.
