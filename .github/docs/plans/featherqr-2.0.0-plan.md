# 2.0.0: API cleanup, the announced removals, and three feature gaps

## Purpose

The core split shipped as `2.0.0-preview.2`: three packages, new namespaces, new repository name. Nothing about the *shape* of the API changed in it, and that was deliberate — the split plan called the renames "a separate workstream that lands in the same major after this plan". This document is that workstream, plus the three feature gaps that the 2026-09-04 reference-library evaluation identified as worth closing before the major closes.

It fixes WHAT changes, in WHICH order, and WHY. HOW each piece is verified follows the mandatory test-first workflow. When the plan completes, its durable content graduates into [specs/qrcode-symbologies.md](../specs/qrcode-symbologies.md) and the per-symbology records, and this file is deleted.

**The window argument.** A public API is added in a minor and removed only in a major. 2.0.0 is the only release in which the accumulated naming drift, the value-type inconsistencies and the deprecated overloads can all be corrected at once, and consumers are already editing every `using` line for the namespace change. Two edits in one line of caller code (`ECCLevel` → `QREccLevel` next to `CreateQrCode` → `Create`) cost the same as one. Everything in Phases 1-3 exists because of that arithmetic; after 2.0.0 the next chance is 3.0.0.

## Scope

| In | Out |
|---|---|
| The announced removals (`Compression`, `GetRequiredBufferSize` ×2, parameter-list generator overloads, `IconData()`) | `CancellationToken` / time-budget decode overloads (additive, 2.1.0) |
| Type and method renames under one naming rule | Payload helpers (deferred by the maintainer; unchanged) |
| Value-kind, immutability and sealing unification | GS1 / FNC1 (unchanged) |
| Symbol geometry in the decode result | A pure-BCL SVG / 1-bit PNG writer (waits for a concrete request) |
| Structured Append, encode and decode (Standard QR only) | `EciMode` as a value type — decided against, see D7 |
| Kanji encoding for all three symbologies | Additional renderer packages |
| Migration table and a mechanical replacement script | Readability heuristics for styled output |

Features are additive and could ship in 2.1.0 without breaking anyone. They are in 2.0.0 because the maintainer chose to make the major a feature-complete line rather than a rename-only one. Kanji encoding is the largest and last of them precisely so it can be demoted to 2.1.0 without disturbing anything else if it slips.

## The naming rule

One rule decides every name in both packages:

> **A prefix says which symbology. No prefix means all three.** The prefixes are `QR` (Standard QR), `MicroQR` and `RmQR`. A noun that literally denotes *a code* keeps the `{Sym}Code` form (`QRCodeData`, `MicroQRCodeGenerator`, `RmQRCodeDecodeInfo`); everything else — enums, ranges, strategies — takes the short prefix. Three-letter acronyms are Pascal-cased (`Ecc`, `Eci`, `Bom`), which the existing `EccLevel` *properties* already are.

Micro QR and rMQR were built after the rule was implicit and already follow it. Every violation is in Standard QR, which was written first, or in a shared type that took the `QRCode` prefix while meaning "the family". That double meaning of `QRCode` — Standard QR in `QRCodeData`, the family in `QRCodeDecodeStatus` — is the actual defect the rule removes.

### Core (`FeatherQR`)

| Now | 2.0.0 | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `ECCLevel` | `QREccLevel` | The only unprefixed enum; siblings are `MicroQREccLevel` and `RmQREccLevel` |
| `QRCodeSegmentation` | `QRSegmentation` | Siblings are `MicroQRSegmentation`, `RmQRSegmentation` |
| `QRCodeVersionRange` | `QRVersionRange` | Sibling is `MicroQRVersionRange` |
| `QRCodeDecodeStatus` | `DecodeStatus` | Shared by all three symbologies; moves out of `QRCodeDecodeInfo.cs` into its own file |
| `QRCodeGenerator.CreateQrCode` | `QRCodeGenerator.Create` | The class already names the symbology; deletes the `Qr` / `QR` casing question rather than answering it |
| `MicroQRCodeGenerator.CreateMicroQRCode` | `MicroQRCodeGenerator.Create` | Same |
| `RmQRCodeGenerator.CreateRmQRCode` | `RmQRCodeGenerator.Create` | Same |
| `QRCodeCalculatedSize.QrSize`, `MicroQRCodeCalculatedSize.QrSize` | `Size` | Matches `QRCodeData.Size`; rMQR's `Width`/`Height` stay |
| `QRCodeGeneratorOptions.Utf8BOM` | `Utf8Bom` | Acronym rule |
| `Internals.StandardQr`, `Internals.RmQr` | `Internals.StandardQR`, `Internals.RmQR` | Internal, but the same rule; test namespaces follow |

### Rendering (`FeatherQR.SkiaSharp`)

| Now | 2.0.0 | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `QRCodeExtensions` | `SKCanvasExtensions` | It holds `SKCanvas` extension methods and nothing else; named after what it extends, as the BCL does |
| `QRCodeRenderer` | `SymbolRenderer` | Renders all three symbologies, so it takes no prefix; "symbol" is the word both standards use |
| `QRCodeImageBuilderBase<TSelf>` | `SymbolImageBuilderBase<TSelf>` | Same reasoning, same word |
| `Vector2Slim` (public) | internal | Appears in no public signature; it is an implementation detail that leaked into the surface |

### Names that deliberately do not change

`QRCodeData`, `QRCodeGenerator`, `QRCodeDecoder`, `QRCodeGeneratorOptions`, `QRCodeCalculatedSize`, `QRCodeDecodeInfo`, `QRCodeImageBuilder`, `QRCodeImageDecoder` and their Micro/rMQR siblings are all "a code" nouns and keep their form. `EciMode`, `ModuleRect` and the shape classes are already correct.

## Removals

| Removed | Announced in | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `Compression` | 1.2.0 `[Obsolete]` | No API accepts or returns it |
| `QRCodeGenerator.GetRequiredBufferSize`, `MicroQRCodeGenerator.GetRequiredBufferSize` | 1.2.0 `[Obsolete]` | `TryGetRequiredBufferSize` is the whole sizing surface afterwards |
| Parameter-list `CreateQrCode` / `CreateMicroQRCode` overloads | Spec, "frozen, removed at 2.0.0" | rMQR never had them and is the shape the other two converge on |
| `IconData()` | `[Obsolete]` ctor | `FromImage` / `FromImageByModules` remain |
| `QRCodeCalculatedSize` public constructor and `IsValid` | Not previously announced | Part of the value-kind unification below; `IsValid` duplicates the `bool` that `TryGetRequiredBufferSize` already returns |

Two consequences to handle inside the phase rather than discover later:

- **`SizingExceptionContractTest` disappears with its subject.** It pins the frozen disagreement between the two deprecated sizing methods (`InvalidOperationException` vs `ArgumentException` for overflow, `ArgumentException` vs `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` for an undefined ECC level). Once both throwing methods are gone the disagreement is gone; the spec paragraph describing it becomes a "lessons learned" entry rather than a live contract.
- **The `options` parameter can finally be defaulted everywhere.** The asymmetry the spec records ("rMQR defaults it, the other two cannot, because their parameter-list overloads would make the call ambiguous") is caused entirely by the overloads being removed here. After the removal all three generators read `Create(text, ecc, in {Sym}CodeGeneratorOptions options = default)`, which is the shape the spec wanted and could not have.

## Shape unification

| Item | Now | 2.0.0 |
|---|---|---|
| `*CalculatedSize` | QR is a `record struct` with a public constructor, `init` setters and `IsValid`; Micro/rMQR are plain `readonly struct`s with internal constructors | One kind: `readonly struct`, internal constructor, get-only properties, no `IsValid`. It is an `out` parameter of a `Try` method, never something a caller builds |
| `*DecodeInfo` | Three `readonly struct`s with different member order; rMQR has no `MaskPattern` (correct — rMQR has one fixed mask) | Same member order everywhere: `Status`, `Version`, `EccLevel`, `MaskPattern` where the symbology defines one, `ErrorsCorrected`, then the new geometry and Structured Append members |
| `GradientOptions` | `record class` holding `SKColor[]` and `float[]` through `init` properties, with a mutable `public static readonly Default` | `sealed class`, constructor copies both arrays, exposes them as read-only, structural equality over elements |
| `IconData` | `class` with public get/set properties and an `[Obsolete]` parameterless constructor | `sealed`, init-only properties, factory methods only |
| `QRCodeData`, `MicroQRCodeData`, `RmQRCodeData`, the three image builders | Non-sealed with no extension point | `sealed`. `SymbolImageBuilderBase<TSelf>` stays public and abstract with a `private protected` constructor; the shape classes stay open on purpose |

**`GradientOptions` carries a live defect, not just a shape problem.** A `record class` generates equality that compares `SKColor[]` by reference, so two gradients with identical colours already compare unequal, and `GradientOptions.Default.Colors[0] = …` mutates the shared instance every caller uses. Both are fixed by the same change, which is why it is in this phase and not filed as a bug.

## Feature work

### Symbol geometry in the decode result

No reference library returns the symbol's position for Standard QR (CodeGlyphX does it for Micro QR only), so this is a differentiator, and it is cheap: the image decoders already build a `PerspectiveTransform`, and the corners are that transform applied to the four corners of module space.

The contract to settle before writing it (D3): which four points, in which space, in which order, and what a matrix-level decode reports. The intended answer is the outer corners of the module area excluding the quiet zone, in source-image pixel coordinates, ordered from the symbol's own top-left — its own, so the quad also conveys rotation and mirroring — with a matrix-level decode leaving the member at its default and a documented way to tell that apart. The type is a small `readonly struct` pair in the core; `System.Numerics.Vector2` is not used, because on netstandard2.0 it would add a package dependency to a package that advertises none.

### Structured Append (Standard QR only)

rMQR does not define it (recorded in [rmqr-encoder.md](../specs/rmqr-encoder.md)) and neither does Micro QR; both keep reporting `UnsupportedContent`. For Standard QR the work is two-sided:

- **Decode** currently rejects the mode as `UnsupportedContent`. After this phase it reads the header and reports symbol index, total count and parity on `QRCodeDecodeInfo`, returning that symbol's own text. A caller concatenates in index order after checking that the parity bytes agree.
- **Encode** splits content across symbols. The parity byte is the XOR of *the original input bytes*, taken before splitting — not derived from the segment plan, which is where CodeGlyphX diverges from every other encoder. QrCodeGenerator is the correct parity reference since its own bug was fixed in `5c6fdfd`.

Open (D4): whether the encode entry point balances the split automatically across the fewest symbols, or takes an explicit count, and whether a "combine these results" helper ships with it. The minimal surface is one method that returns the symbols plus documented rules for recombination; a helper is easy to add in a minor and impossible to remove.

### Kanji encoding

Today all three symbologies decode Kanji mode and none of them writes it; the scope row in [qrcode-symbologies.md](../specs/qrcode-symbologies.md) says "decode only, revisit on concrete demand". This phase flips that row. Four pieces:

1. **A reverse table**, Unicode → the 13-bit compacted value, generated by `tools/QRInteropFixtures` from the same sweep data that produced `ShiftJisKanjiTable`, so the two cannot disagree. Characters outside the JIS X 0208 repertoire simply have no reverse entry and fall through to Byte mode, which is also what makes the seven-cell CP932 divergence a non-issue for encoding.
2. **A Kanji state in `ModeSegmenter`** (7 states → 8), at a flat 13 bits per character, with per-symbology and per-version availability the way `allowAlnum` / `allowByte` already work: Micro QR M3 and M4 only, all rMQR versions, all Standard QR versions. The per-symbology Kanji count-indicator tables already exist on the decode side.
3. **`EncodingMode` gains Kanji.** The enum deliberately excludes it today ("that enum names the modes the encoder can produce"); this phase is what makes that comment false.
4. **Cross-verification against the external oracles** (qrtool, ZXingCpp, ZXing.Net, libzint) plus committed fixtures, since a Kanji encoder that no third-party reader agrees with is worse than no Kanji encoder.

Two decisions inside the phase. **D5:** whether single-mode selection picks Kanji automatically. It is the cheapest single mode for Japanese text, so saying yes changes the bytes the library emits by default for existing callers — acceptable in a major, and it is what other libraries do, but it must be a decision and a migration note rather than a side effect. **D6:** whether a plan may mix Kanji segments with ECI-tagged Byte segments in one symbol. Legal per the standard, historically uneven across readers; the oracle sweep from piece 4 answers it, and the conservative fallback is to suppress Kanji whenever an ECI header is emitted.

## Open decisions

| # | Decision | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Drop the `string` convenience overloads once the parameter-list overloads are gone? | Drop. The spec already schedules this re-evaluation: `string` converts implicitly to `ReadOnlySpan<char>` on all four target frameworks, so they contribute a parameter name and nothing else, and they double the entry-point count in IntelliSense |
| D2 | `SymbolRenderer` / `SymbolImageBuilderBase<TSelf>` as the shared-renderer names | Confirm at the start of Phase 2; renaming twice is the only expensive outcome |
| D3 | Geometry contract: which corners, which space, which order, matrix-level behaviour | As described above; write it into the XML docs and a test before the implementation |
| D4 | Structured Append encode API shape and whether a combine helper ships | Auto-balanced split, no combine helper in 2.0.0 |
| D5 | Does `Segmentation.Single` choose Kanji mode automatically? | Yes, with a migration note; explicit `Utf8Bom` / `EciMode` settings keep Byte mode |
| D6 | Kanji segments mixed with ECI-tagged Byte segments | Let the oracle sweep decide; suppress Kanji under ECI if any oracle disagrees |
| D7 | `EciMode` enum → a value type with `FromValue` / `Value` | **No.** An encoder can only emit a charset it can convert text into (Latin-1 and UTF-8), and the decoder reports every other ECI as `UnsupportedContent` without needing to carry the number. A value type would also need a sentinel for "no ECI", which collides with the real ECI 0, in exchange for expressing values nothing can produce or consume. Recorded as a scope decision with this reason rather than left open |

## Phases

Each phase follows the test-first workflow, regenerates both `PublicAPI.approved.txt` files, updates `docs/migration.md` and the affected specs in the same change, and appends a Progress log entry with Done / Lessons / benchmark delta. A phase that moves a hot path measures it; a phase that only renames states that it did not.

| # | Phase | Contents | Exit |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Announced removals | The removals table; retire `SizingExceptionContractTest`; default the `options` parameter on all three generators | Surface shrinks, no rename yet |
| 2 | Renames | Both rename tables; internal namespaces and test namespaces follow; D1 and D2 answered | One reviewable `PublicAPI.approved.txt` diff |
| 3 | Shape unification | `*CalculatedSize`, `*DecodeInfo` member order, `GradientOptions`, `IconData`, sealing, `Vector2Slim` | **API-final for the cleanup.** Tag `2.0.0-preview.3` |
| 4 | Symbol geometry | D3, the geometry members on all three `*DecodeInfo`, all three image decode paths | Matrix-level decode behaviour documented and tested |
| 5 | Structured Append | D4, decode-side header reporting, encode-side split, parity over original input bytes | Round-trip plus oracle cross-check |
| 6 | Kanji encoding | D5, D6, reverse table, segmenter state, `EncodingMode`, capacity docs | Oracle sweep green. Tag `2.0.0-preview.4` |
| 7 | Docs and API freeze | `docs/migration.md` 2.0.0 section rewritten with the full rename table and a mechanical replacement script; README, DESIGN.md, spec scope rows (Kanji, Structured Append, geometry); fold this plan into the specs and delete it | Approved API listing frozen |
| 8 | Release | Below | `2.0.0` on nuget.org |

Phases 4-6 are independent of each other and depend only on 1-3. Phase 6 is last so that it can move to 2.1.0 without reopening anything.

## Release checklist (Phase 8)

- `tools/QRInteropFixtures` manual spot-checks, including new ones for Kanji-mode and Structured Append symbols
- Physical scanner acceptance pass, weighted toward Kanji-mode and Structured Append symbols, which are the two outputs no committed fixture can prove a phone accepts
- `PackageValidationBaselineVersion` set to `2.0.0` in both packed projects — the csproj comments already say "no baseline until 2.0.0 ships; set it then"
- `SkiaSharp.QrCode` 2.0.0 stays an empty metapackage; `tools/check_package_deps.cs` asserts the graph after pack, as it does today
- Version bump: `tools/bump_version.cs` parses only `X.Y.Z`, so going from `2.0.0-preview.4` to `2.0.0` is a hand edit of `Directory.Build.props` and the README install lines, or the tool learns prerelease first. Decide which inside the phase; the tool already prints the manual instruction
- GitHub release notes lead with the migration table link; the Playground redeploys from the same tag

## Progress log

Nothing implemented yet. Entries are appended per phase: what was done, what was learned, and the benchmark delta or an explicit statement that no hot path moved.
